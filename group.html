<h1>
  APS Personality and Individual Differences Psychology Interest Group
</h1>

<p>
The Australian Psychological Society provides the opportunity people to develop
and run interest groups related to the discipline and practice of psychology.
</p>

<p>
Many of our conference attendees are also members of the Interest Group.  It is
through the APS and the Interest Group that we are able to manage the finances
of the group and the conference.
</p>

<p>
You do not have to be a member of the APS to be a member of the Interest Group.
More information can be found at <a href="http://www.groups.psychology.org.au/igs/">the Interest Group website</a>.
