<p>
This year's conference is being organised by Peter Jonason from the University of Western Sydney. Details of abstract submission, conference location, registration and accommodation will be added over the weeks to come
</p>

<p>
The last few years at ACPID has seen an increase in attention paid to applied outcomes for personality and individual differences (e.g., educational outcomes, organizational psychology). This year, we hope to make a return to basics. This year we are asking for submissions on three themes (broadly defined). First, we are interested in theory papers; one’s testing predictions that test some larger theory (i.e., ultimate or proximal theories) as well as larger theoretical issues in relation to personality and individual differences. Second, we are interested in psychometric papers. The topics of how we measure traits, can we measure traits, and what are the structural properties of the traits are essential to our field. Third, there have been impressive developments in statistical techniques to deal with the varied and complex data we often collect. We are interested in new statistical treatments, new measures, and new measurement techniques. These themes follow a recent Special Issue in Personality and Individual Differences, and we hope you will add to this conversation at this year’s ACPID.
