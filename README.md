# ACPID

This is the website for the Australian Conference on Personality and
Individual Differences.

This website uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) for
generating the pages from the layouts etc. You do not need to install
Jekyll yourself unless you wish to generate and view the pages on your
own computer. GitHub will automatically generate the site for us given
the updated pages etc.
