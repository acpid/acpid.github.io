<p>
This year's conference is being organised by Shane Costello and the Understanding Personality Abilities and Individual Differences Research Team (<i>un</i>PAID-RT) from Monash University. Details of abstract submission, conference location, registration and accommodation are shown below.
</p>

<p>
We are excited to announce that the ACPID conference is returning to Melbourne for 2016.  Join us in the vibrant beachside suburb of St Kilda for another enjoyable and stimulating gathering of people with a passion for personality and individual differences psychology: researchers, practitioners and (most importantly) students. This year we will be joined by a number of internationally renowned researchers in the field of individual differences, as well as showcasing the latest in Australian research. To add a little more excitement (not that we needed more!), the conference proceedings for 2016 will undergo a blind peer-review process, followed by online publication of either abstracts or full papers.  
</p>
<p>
The theme for the conference is <i>"Individual differences: Implications for research and practice"</i>. Rather than impose any restriction on the type of papers to be presented, we wish to challenge presenters to discuss the implications of their studies from both research and clinical perspectives. Even the most exotic and theoretical of topics can still have clinical relevance. Given the extent of the divide between research and practice in psychology, it is hoped that in some small way we can use this opportunity to highlight the implications for the <i>individual</i> through the study of individual differences. We look forward to seeing you at this year's conference!

St Kilda is renowned for its expansive view of Port Phillip, safe sandy beach, palm-lined boardwalk, huge range of beach activities, big skies, gorgeous sunsets, parks and gardens, great restaurants, bars and cafes, fabulous old buildings, and its colourful past and present. St Kilda is home to many of Melbourne's famous visitor attractions including Luna Park, the Esplanade Hotel, Catani Gardens, Acland Street and Fitzroy Street. It is home to St Kilda beach, Melbourne's most famous beach, several renowned theatres and several of Melbourne's big events and festivals.

<p>
The main street in St Kilda is Fitzroy Street. It is lined with outdoor pubs, cafes and restaurants serving a wide variety of cuisines showcasing Melbourne's multicultural heritage.
