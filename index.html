<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>
The Australian Conference on Personality and Individual Differences was first
held in 2001 and has become an annual event for personality and individual
researchers, academics, practitioners and students. Our conference is held in
late November to early December each year over two to three days and includes
workshops, oral and poster presentations of Australia’s leading edge
personality and individual differences research.
</p>

<p>
Our History link shows the development of the conference since 2001. Each year
the conference is organised by members from universities throughout Australia. 
</p>

<p>
Many of the conference attendees are also members of the Australian
Psychological Society’s Personality and Individual Psychology interest group.
This is constituted with a committee consisting of Convenor, Treasurer,
Secretary and Student Representative.
</p>

<p>
Research in personality and individual differences is a worldwide endeavour as
demonstrated by the organisations shown on our links page.
</p>

<p>
If you have an interest in personality and individual differences you would be
most warmly welcome to attend our next conference.
