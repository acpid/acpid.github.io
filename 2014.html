<h3>About Newcastle</h3>

<p>
Newcastle is Australia's second oldest city and has served as a harsh penal
outpost, 'steel city' and industrial centre, and (now) the largest
coal-exporting port in the world. It reaches out to the sea, creating
Australia's only city centre bounded by pristine beaches and an active working
harbour. From our intriguing 200 year story has arisen a dynamic city of
contrasts. Discover a port city in transition and delight in a mixture of the
raw and refined. Working wharves are becoming places of play; the city hums
with a vibrant arts culture and an emerging food scene is evident. Some things
need never change - the surf is still world class, the pace remains relaxed and
the friendly locals are proud of their city. See <a href="http://visitnewcastle.com.au/">Visit Newcastle</a>.
</p>

<h3>Getting Around Newcastle</h3>

<p>
<i>From visitnewcastle.com.au:</i>
</p>

<p>
Fare Free Bus Zone &mdash; State Transit buses (that's the blue and white ones) are
FREE within the inner city zone along Hunter Street from the Catholic Cathedral
to Newcastle Railway Station, and as far south as Bull Street on Darby Street.
The fare free zone operates between 7:30am and 6:00pm seven days a week. This
is a fantastic way to get around the inner city for free without the hassles of
driving and parking. Normal fares apply for travel outside of this zone. Ask
the bus driver if you are unsure of the route or destination. Timetables for
the Newcastle Buses are <a href="http://www.newcastlebuses.info/">available online</a>.
</p>

<h3>Parking</h3>

<p>
If you are traveling to Newcastle by car there is parking available the
Travelodge Hotel.
</p>

<h3>Eating &amp; Drinking in Newcastle</h3>

<p>
There are two "eat streets" in Newcastle:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Darby St, about 15 minutes walk from the conference hotel, just after the
  City Hall, Civic Park and the Art Gallery, and
  </li>
  <li>
  Beaumont St, which is west of the conference hotel and further away (known
  for Italian restaurants). Also, Hunter St Mall and the east end of the city
  is becoming known for its cafés and small restaurants.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
In addition, a newer restaurant and bar strip is the Boardwalk, on the harbour
quite near the conference hotel &mdash; but you have to go east along Hunter St to
the Merewether St railway crossing to get there, OR cross the bridge at Wickham
Railway station (350 metres west of the hotel). Either way, it's about a 15-20
minutes walk, We will meet after the first day for drinks at the large modern
Honeysuckle Hotel overlooking the harbour, and the conference dinner will be at
one of the Boardwalk restaurants nearby.
</p>

<h3>Things to do in Newcastle</h3>

<p>
<b>Walk the Foreshore</b> &mdash; an excellent walk or jog for your morning or
evening exercise is to go down to the harbour foreshore (via either the
Merewether St railway crossing or the bridge at Wickham Station) and head east
towards Nobby's (the lighthouse station).  There is a wide walkway all the way,
passing numerous historic and modern points of interest. From the Foreshore
Park there is an excellent view of the Anglican Cathedral on the hill and the
city with its mix of old and new, especially in the morning sunshine. Allow
about an hour there and back at a steady walking pace. Or linger and watch the
ships in the harbour (some of the world's largest bulk carriers come and go).
Or continue past Nobby's and out to the end of the breakwater (add half an
hour).
</p>

<p>
<b>Return by Newcastle Beach</b> &mdash; continue past Nobby's Beach and round
to the Ocean Baths and Newcastle Beach, then through the Hunter St Mall (lots
of cafés on the way) and back along Hunter St or King St. Add half an hour to
the Foreshore walk. OR continue along Newcastle Beach and up to King Edward
Park and The Hill (interesting relics of WWII coastal defences, and The Bogey
Hole, dug from the rocks by convicts for the pleasure of an early Commandant),
then back down the steep hill to Hunter St Mall and King or Hunter streets. Add
a further half hour.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bring your surfboard</b> &mdash; there is no shortage of surf.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wander the streets</b> &mdash; Urban Walkabout has compiled a number of
walks around Newcastle, which can be found <a href="http://www.urbanwalkabout.com/newcastle/walks">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Visit Newcastle Museum and the Maritime Centre</b> (both in the Honeysuckle
area near the Boardwalk restaurants), and <b>Fort Scratchley</b> (near Nobby's). The
latter was built in the late 1800s to defend against Russia! On the top are the
naval guns that fired on a Japanese submarine that shelled Newcastle in June
1942.
</p>

<p>
<b>Visit the Northern Regional Art Gallery</b>, opposite the City Hall and
about a 10 minute walk from the Travelodge Hotel. This is one of the best
regional galleries in Australia, in a city that is known for its artistic
activities and talent. Special exhibitions at the time of the conference
include the Kilgour Prize for figurative and portrait painting, and a new
exhibition by Patricia Paccinini (Australian sculptor) opening on Saturday
29th. There are several other public and private galleries in the area,
including <b>Watt Space</b> &mdash; the University of Newcastle's student art
gallery hosts exhibitions that support emerging student artists and is open to
the public from 11-5pm Wednesday to Sunday. It's in Auckland St, in the
University Law and Commerce building just before you get to the City Hall.
</p>

<p>
<b>Visit the local shops</b> &mdash; head to either Darby Street or the Hunter
Mall to explore local boutiques and meet the homegrown designers.  The city has
tried to renew the central area in recent months by allowing art and craft
startups to occupy vacant shops cheaply. For everyday things <b>Marketown</b> is a
fairly comprehensive <b>shopping centre directly opposite the Travelodge</b>, with
both Coles and Woolworths and their partners, cafés, chemists, etc., (even a
McDonalds!).
</p>

<p>
<b>If you have a car</b> (or hire one) there are several <b>day trips from
  Newcastle</b> &mdash; up the Hunter Valley to the vineyards, cellar door
tastings, and restaurants, to Port Stevens resorts and dolphin watching (no
whales in November, regrettably), to Barrington Tops National Park, etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bushwalking in Glenrock</b> &mdash; only ten minutes drive from the
Newcastle city centre, Glenrock State Conservation Area is a beautiful coastal
rainforest. A number of scenic trails can be found
<a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/glenrock-state-conservation-area/map">online</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ride the Fernleigh track</b> &mdash; A historic rail that is now a cycleway
linking Newcastle and Lake Macquarie. The 15km track passes through beautiful
bushland, wetland forests, and coastal heaths. Bikes can be hired from $20 for
1 hour or $40 for 1 day through <a href="http://www.boomerangbikehire.com.au">Boomerang Bike Hire</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Farmers and Makers Market</b> &mdash; held Newcastle Showground most Sundays
from 8-1pm, the Farmers and Makers Market brings together local farmers and
producers. Among the gourmet food products you will find fresh pastas, cheese,
pastries, boutique wines and much more.
